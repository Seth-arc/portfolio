                <p>The next 10 years are going to be incredibly important. Universities will face more financial constraints and have to secure a minimum number of first year enrolment (that they have to pay for) in order to define existence. The skills development model that's winning right now is hyper nimble.

You recieve an email from a major tech company asking if you'd be interested in completing their 'credientialised' learning programme. <p>The email says if you complete the programme at certification level (80% average), you will have access to their 'hiring coach' who will guide you through resume, profile and interview skills that they think you'll need to hit the job market after you're done.

You complete the programme. You get an invite to a Slack channel for people who completed the programme. The channel consists of company 'mentors' who answer questions you might have, share training and job opportunities within and beyond the company, and keep you updated on trends in the company. <p>You're networking internationally with peers and industry heads invited to present at webinars by the company. People are sharing their amazing hobby projects and gaining industry momentum.

After a few months, they send you another email. Asking if you're interested in another 'advanced' training programme. It's linked to the one you already completed. If you complete this programme, you qualify for a free certification exam. </p><p>This will mean you now have industry title e.g. IT/Cloud Administrator, Software Engineer, Data Analyst etc. All programmes include 'soft skill' modules.

You bite. Complete the programme. You write the exam and pass. You are now accredited by an industry leading organisation and anyone who uses their services is trying to find a way to hire in for their service instead of an external provider. They get in touch with entry level job opportunities that fit your profile on the basis of assumed skill level and geographic location.

A few good ones targeted at an Afrikan audience are the annual Google Developer Scholarship as well as the Nedbank and Microsoft driven Digiskills Training Platform.

All this is happening on a device you keep in your pocket. You didn't have to convince or remind anyone....</p>

    <div class="info_">
        <p>The Valenture Institute's online school business model has the potential to introduce a new approach to schooling that has already led to some interesting social reorganisation effects.</p>

            <p>As a tech-enabled online school founded by the South African-born entrepreneur Robert Paddock (also original founder of 2U acquired GetSmarter), the organisation is already doing big things in the market. Securing a $7 million (R114 million) investment backed by GSV Ventures in 2020 with the lofty ambition of being the largest online school in the world by 2028.
            
            However, it is the small scall changes taking place around Valenture's offerings that provide the most interesting insights.</p> <p>A group of mothers in Khayelitsha, Western Cape collectively took their children out of the local public school and are now taking turns daily to be school day facilitator from their homes. This is supported by numerous free and paid for resources provided by the Institute on various online platforms.
            
            Khayelitsha, like many South African townships, consists of communities with limited financial means. This new arrangement has meant that these mothers have cumulated savings from child care, transport, uniform, books etc, and have each successfuly negotiated for four-day work weeks.</p><p>This is a prime example of the pivot disruption opportunities opening up in the otherwise singular educational model within the country and may provide further impetus to the controversial calls for online learning as equaliser. It would be a valuable exercise to keep an eye on this in the development of Western Cape's ongoing investor calls through WesGro,the province's trade and investment promotion agency.
            
            Another community in Northern Cape went about it by renting the local church building as premises and hiring two community based facilitators to assist children in their schooling through Valenture. They essentially redirected their savings from fees, transport, uniforms, books etc, into employing two young people from their community and keeping their church solvent.</p><p>It will be interesting to observe the uptake in this trend within previously disadvanted areas outside of the major city centres. There may be an interesting goldmine of data on the horizon.</p>
            
            <p>In a thought provoking conversatio on the Around the Table with George Eadie podcast, Robert Paddock unpacks his views on the access and quality in the South African education system and also shares the major selling points discussed in this post which clinched the UCT and St. Stithians projects. The EdTech arena witihn the country is searching for the sweetspot which provides growth on the basis of customer mobilisation at group and community levels. These and other case studies are thee model for any other online school venture.</p>

        <p>This is Proffessor Stephen Downes from the University of Manitoba in Canada (when I last checked).</p>

            <p>His website is what I imagine the new world university to be. I happened upon it while engaging with the work of George Siemens on connectivism. It's been a great find.
            
            He has high quality content MOOCs. He freely shares books that he's written. He collates insightful podcast episodes and long form articles on his subject of choice from across the internet daily.</p><p>He writes a daily blog. He even shared a 'Current Projects' google doc so you can see and engage with what he's busy reading, writing and thinking of presenting on at a particular time.
            
            Every major website (outside of the media) is now tasked with 3 objectives in order to qualify its existence. Does it inform and actively teach? Does it facilitate or make available further opportunities? Does it render an end to end service? Everything else is peripheral to the current digital marketplace.</p>
            
            <p>I take a peek at his site almost every day and I'm inspired by it but also a little embarrassed at how little information I share openly with people who might need it. Is it cynicism or apathy? Regardless, if the internet is to reach its developmental potential, we need many many more people like him. I'm pretty sure Afrika has enough to cause a shift.
            
            </p><p>Wouldn't that be something?.</p>
